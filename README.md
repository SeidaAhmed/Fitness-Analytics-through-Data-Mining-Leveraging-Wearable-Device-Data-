# Research Questions

1. **What patterns can be identified in user fitness metrics (Age, gender, weight, BMI) and Heart Rate Metrics (max BPM, avg BPM, resting BPM) and their impact on calorie burn and fat percentage?**
   - This question explores how physiological factors (**Age**, **Gender**, **Weight**, **BMI**, **Heart Rate**) influence calorie expenditure and fat loss. The goal is to identify which variables are the strongest predictors of fat burn.

2. **How do different workout types, session durations, and workout frequencies correlate with calorie burn, fat percentage changes, and BMI?**
   - This examines how various exercise routines affect fat loss and calorie expenditure over time. It aims to determine whether longer workout sessions, higher intensity levels (**max BPM**, **avg BPM**), or specific workout types (e.g., strength training vs. cardio) lead to greater fat reduction and calorie burn.

3. **How do hydration (water intake) and resting BPM influence workout efficiency, calorie expenditure, and fat percentage reduction?**
   - This question investigates whether higher hydration levels improve workout efficiency and fat burn. It also analyzes whether a lower resting BPM (a sign of better cardiovascular fitness) correlates with higher calorie burn efficiency.

4. **How can insights from these patterns be used to develop personalized fitness recommendations for optimizing fat burn, calorie management, and overall fitness?**
   - This applies the findings to create tailored workout recommendations, suggesting ideal workout frequencies, durations, and intensity levels based on user-specific attributes like BMI, age, and experience level.
